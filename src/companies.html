                        <p>TravelGround was started by four South Africans with a shared passion for exploring their country. This led to many, often frustrating, hours spent trying to find the right accommodation via the web, unsure of which sites' reviews we could trust and stymied by confusing web pages. They felt that there had to be a better way, and in 2008 set out to build the perfect accommodation search website. The result is TravelGround.com, the best way to find and book accommodation anywhere in South Africa.</p>
